# current-efforts

A simple tool for a fixed amount (=4) of notes. 
For instance to visualize your current efforts (e.g., projects).

Notes are saved locally, and not transferred between devices

## Design philosophy

- no server needed, as it is hosted on github as a static page
- it works basically as a local app, which automatically updates over the internet on a refresh
- no external dependencies, just html, css and javascript
- local data handling ensures that privacy is preserved

## Inspiration

- inspiration from productivity matrices that are often 2x2 (i.e., quadrants): like eisenhower or OKR matrix
